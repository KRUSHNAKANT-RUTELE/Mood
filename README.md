Mood Changer Project – Description

The Mood Changer is a simple front-end project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to change a displayed emoji based on their mood by clicking buttons.
The project has two buttons: Happy and Sad. When the user clicks the Happy button, a happy emoji appears. When the Sad button is clicked, a sad emoji is shown. After a short time, the emoji automatically returns to a normal face. This behavior is controlled using an asynchronous (async/await) JavaScript function with a time delay.
This project demonstrates basic web development concepts such as:
1 DOM manipulation
2 Event handling
3 Async/await and Promises in JavaScript
4 Simple UI design with CSS
It is a beginner-friendly project that helps in understanding how JavaScript interacts with web pages to create dynamic behavior.1
